title: Persistent Monitoring for Agriculture
summary: 
  The deployment of a group of robots equipped with sensors for monitoring, also known as a robotic sensor network, is a promising technological solution to solve time-critical societal and environmental issues. This research topic focus on **how to deploy a robotic sensor network to persistently and effectively monitor multiple locations of interest in a large field represented by grids**.

## Research results:
- [[AGRICONTROL2022](../../publication/priandana-2022/)]
  [[ACCESS2024](../../publication/atman-2024/)]
  Proposes layered control framework combining task allocation strategy (modified ant-colony optimization) and voronoi-based coverage control approach.

- [[CASE2024](../../publication/fikri-2024/)]
  Investigate improvement for the task allocation strategy by relaxation of the original non-smooth objective functions.
