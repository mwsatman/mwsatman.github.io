title: Safe-Critical Distributed Optimization of MRS with Multi-Objective
summary: 
  Traditionally, augmenting additional objectives and constraint commonly requires a redesign of the existing cooperative control framework. Recently, an emerging approach via control barrier function (CBF) allows a more
  streamlined way to incorporate multiple objectives and safety requirements as constraints within an optimization problem. 
  This research topic focus on **how to guarantee safety deployment of MRS under multiple objectives within an unstructured environment**.
