title: Human-Centered Design for Human-MRS Interaction
summary: 
  The cooperation between Multi Robot System (MRS) and human operator is capable of alleviating existing limitation on the MRS’s autonomy, e.g., the human operator can help to provide an alternative in the case of deadlock where the only
  feasible solution is to do nothing. To promote scalability and reduce the human’s workload, it is desirable
  for the operator to control only a small set of the robots or provide only a high-level command.
  This research topic focus on **how to improve Human-MRS interaction with emphasis on trust, transparency, and minimizing human workload.**

## Research results:
- [[IJIRA2018](../../publication/atman-2018/)]
  [[ISCS](../../publication/atman-2018-a/)]
  Proposes control framework for Human-MRS interaction via a dissipative-based approach that can guarantee stability and fulfillment of control objective in the application of cooperative transportation.

- [[AIM2017](../../publication/yamauchi-2017/)]
  [[CSM2020](../../publication/funada-2020/)]
  Addresses the issue of communication delay in Human-MRS interaction (based on dissipative approach).

- [[CPHS2019](../../publication/atman-2019/)]
  Present user-studies result and use system identification method to
  model the human operator during different interaction setups. The results not only provides evidence that the
  human model can be assumed as a dissipative process, but also highlight the different perceived workload of
  the human operator in response to changes on communication network topolog
