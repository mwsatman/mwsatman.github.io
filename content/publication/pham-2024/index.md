abstract: This paper considers the problem of formation
  control of multi-robot systems represented by a graph featuring
  both rigid and elastic edges, capturing specified range tolerance
  to the desired inter-robot distances. The objective is to navigate
  the robots safely through unknown environments with obstacles,
  utilizing onboard sensors like LiDAR while maintaining 
  inter-robot distance constraints. To this end, a novel cooperative
  control algorithm is proposed, employing quadratic programming 
  and leveraging control barrier functions to integrate
  multiple control objectives seamlessly. This approach ensures a
  unified strategy and provides a safety certificate. Experimental
  validation of the proposed cooperative control algorithm is
  conducted using a robotic testbed.
