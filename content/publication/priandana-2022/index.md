abstract: This paper considers the use of static and mobile sensors (quadrotors) for
  persistent monitoring in an indoor farming scenario. The focus is on autonomous
  navigation of the quadrotors to monitor the coverage holes generated by a number
  of broken static sensors. To that end, a three-layer strategy is proposed by (i)
  dividing the coverage holes into several region-of-interests (ROIs); (ii) selecting
  the quadrotor(s) responsible for monitoring each ROI using a novel Modified Ant
  Colony Optimization; (iii) designing coverage control with time-varying density
  function for ensuring persistent monitoring. Simulation results demonstrate the
  efficacy of the proposed strategy in persistently minimizing the coverage holes
  over time.
