Three-loop autopilot is a classic linear flight control scheme that is still being used nowadays. With the help of classical gainscheduling method it is expected that the implementation can help improve the response of the system. The scopes of this paper include design procedures and analysis from the model linear, design of linear autopilot, until the design of the gainscheduling autopilot. The addition of anti-windup and the effects of discretization and delay are also included in the discussion. The results showed that the designed gain scheduled autopilot is stable in nonlinear model testing and also in digital implementation and the effect of the delay.},

Autopilot implemented by using classical gain-scheduling method that designed to work within certain velocity and angle-of-attack (AOA). Input command for the autopilot is provided by guidance system which processed kinematic and dynamic of the rocket, so it could follow the desired trajectory. Guidance and autopilot were implemented together with the navigation system and nonlinear model of the rocket using Hardware-in Loop Simulation (HILS) on PC/104. Results showed that the designed gain-scheduling autopilot is stable on nonlinear model tests and also on delay effect and digital implementation tests, with acceptable transient and steady state performance.

The objective is to guarantee human-enabled motion synchronization to desired position/velocity references. The presence of a human in the system could improve performance in completing complex missions and adaptation to changes in environment or mission goal. Although in some works the human is modeled or assumed as a passive system, this does not always hold and a systematic solution to deal with non-passive humans is still needed. To this end, this paper assumes the human operator's process as a passivity-short system. Based on the positive feedback interconnection of passivity-short systems, we present a novel distributed control architecture interconnecting the human operator and the robotic swarm. The control goals are then proved to be achieved even in the presence of passivity shortage in the human operator. We finally demonstrate the proposed architecture through simulation studies and also implementation on an experimental testbed.},

First, we briefly introduce the passivity-short-based architecture presented in one of our previous works, which guarantees human-enabled motion synchronization to desired position/velocity references under the assumption that the human operator's thought process is a passivity-short system. It is observed that changes in parameter affects the visual feedback to the operator and also the complexity of the setups. Through user-studies using a human-in-the-loop simulator and questionnaires, we observe an increase in the perceived workload of the human operator for more complex setups. The result imposes the trade-off for less workload vs. clarity of the robotic swarms' information to the human operator. Furthermore, through non-parametric system identification on data from user-studies, it is observed that all obtained models of the participants have the passivity-short property.},

  abstract = {The strong connectivity of a directed graph associated with the communication network topology is crucial in ensuring the convergence of many distributed estimation/control/optimization algorithms. However, the assumption on the network's strong connectivity may not always be satisfied in practice. In addition, information on the overall network topology is often not available, e.g., due to privacy concerns or geographical constraints which calls for a distributed algorithm. This paper aims to fill a crucial gap in the literature due to the absence of a fully distributed algorithm to verify and ensure in finite-time the strong connectivity of a directed network. Specifically, inspired by the maximum consensus algorithm we propose distributed algorithms that enable individual node in a networked system to verify the strong connectivity of a directed graph and further, if necessary, augment a minimum number of new links to ensure the directed graph's strong connectivity. The proposed distributed algorithms are implemented without requiring information of the overall network topology and are scalable as they only require finite storage and converge in finite number of steps. Furthermore, the algorithms also preserve the privacy in terms of the overall network's topology. Finally, the proposed distributed algorithms are demonstrated and evaluated via numerical results.},

This paper considers the problem of deploying a robotic sensor network to persistently and effectively monitor multiple locations of interest in a large field represented by grids. To this end, we propose a novel two-layer control framework where the first layer (i.e., task allocation strategy) encapsulates the targeted grids into a set of tasks (small regions of interest) followed by optimally allocating the robots to each task based on their initial position (location of their base stations) and sensing capabilities. The second layer (i.e., persistent monitoring algorithm) generates each robot's motion control input to ensure persistent monitoring over the designated region of interest. The proposed framework is demonstrated and evaluated via numerical simulations. It is shown that the proposed control framework improves real-time monitoring in terms of both the coverage performance and travel distance of the robots.},

Additionally, online learning is needed for the robot to maneuver in an unknown environment which leads to dealing with the sampled data set size, memory, and computational complexity. We address these challenges by designing an online non-parametric LiDAR-based safety function using the Gaussian process (GP). It is both efficient in data size and eliminates the requirement to store previous data. Then, a CBF is synthesized using the proposed safety function to rectify the safe control input. The effectiveness of the LiDAR-based CBF synthesis for navigation in unknown environments was validated by conducting experiments on unicycle-type robots.},

Early treatment can be conduct from detection of microaneurysms. The main concentration of this paper is the algorithm to detect microaneurysm with mathematical morphology. The mathematical morphology is choosen because microaneurysms tend to have typical shape. Generally, the algorithm is consist of three stages. The first is preprocessing, the second is detecting candidate microaneurysms, and the third is postprocessing handling the process of removing unused features. The performances is evaluated using the database from DIARETDB1 which provides ground truth collected from several experts and a strict evaluation protocol. The optimal performance will be satified when considering green channel obtaining, PAL size image processing, adaptive histogram equalization threshold at 0.03, canny edge detection threshold at 0.16, MAs and optimum microaneurysms size at 5 to 16 pixels.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the development of a resilient cooperative control system for leader-follower consensus problems prone to external cyber-attacks. The attackers are assumed to adversely impact data integrity and privacy by (i) injecting unknown bounded exogenous signals to actuators and (ii) eavesdropping on the physical states of followers. To mitigate the adverse effects of such attacks on the consensus, privacy, and stability of leader-follower systems, we develop a resilient cooperative control system by introducing virtual states interconnected with the physical states in such a way that the leader-follower consensus is guaranteed under unknown false data injection cyber-attacks. The dynamics of the virtual states act as a dynamical output mask, which maps the physical states of followers to some virtual states that are exchanged via a communication network. A Lyapunov-based design framework is proposed to guarantee stability and the leader-follower consensus against cyber-attacks. The decentralized design of the control variables in the proposed resilient cooperative control approach facilitates creating a plug-and-play environment, where follower nodes can easily be plugged in/out. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is evaluated using several numerical examples and implementation on a planar robot experimental testbed.},

  abstract = {State-of-charge is an important variable in a battery management system. However, it cannot be measured directly from a battery. Instead, it is estimated from measurable variables like current and voltage. This paper addresses a discrete-time observer-based SOC estimation such that it has an asymptotic stability guarantee with some assumptions. The second-order equivalent circuit model and a piecewise linear approximation representing a relationship between the state-of-charge and the open circuit voltage are utilized. Simulations are conducted in Python to evaluate the designed observer. Some simulation scenarios also include the appearance of the model uncertainty, disturbance, and measurement noise. The estimated state-of-charge can track the real one for these situations, despite performance degradation.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a cooperative control law of human-robotic networks in the presence of inter-robot communication delays. The objective is to guarantee human enabled synchronization of positions of robotic network to desired reference. We first design a cooperative controller to be implemented on each robot so that their motion are synchronized to a reference motion desired by a human operator. Then, we point out that each robot motion ensures passivity. Furthermore, inter-robot communication channels are designed via so-called scattering transformation which is a technique to passify the delayed channel. The resulting robotic network is then connected with human operator based on passivity theory. In order to demonstrate the present control architecture, we build an experimental testbed consisting of multiple robots and an interface for interactions with human operator. In particular, we analyze the effects of the communication delays on the human operator's behavior.},
