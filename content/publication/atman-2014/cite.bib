 abstract = {This paper gives an overview of classical gainscheduling design applicable to three-loop attitude autopilot. Three-loop autopilot is a classic linear flight control scheme that is still being used nowadays. With the help of classical gainscheduling method it is expected that the implementation can help improve the response of the system. The scopes of this paper include design procedures and analysis from the model linear, design of linear autopilot, until the design of the gainscheduling autopilot. The addition of anti-windup and the effects of discretization and delay are also included in the discussion. The results showed that the designed gain scheduled autopilot is stable in nonlinear model testing and also in digital implementation and the effect of the delay.},
