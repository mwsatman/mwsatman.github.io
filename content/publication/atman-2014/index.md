abstract: This paper gives an overview of classical gainscheduling design applicable
  to three-loop attitude autopilot. Three-loop autopilot is a classic linear flight
  control scheme that is still being used nowadays. With the help of classical gainscheduling
  method it is expected that the implementation can help improve the response of the
  system. The scopes of this paper include design procedures and analysis from the
  model linear, design of linear autopilot, until the design of the gainscheduling
  autopilot. The addition of anti-windup and the effects of discretization and delay
  are also included in the discussion. The results showed that the designed gain scheduled
  autopilot is stable in nonlinear model testing and also in digital implementation
  and the effect of the delay.
