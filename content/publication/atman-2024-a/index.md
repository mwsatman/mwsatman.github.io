abstract: This paper presents a distributed algorithm for
  ensuring the strong connectivity of spatially distributed networks where the communication network topology depends on
  both the position and communication range of the nodes. This is
  achieved by adding new links via adjusting the communication
  range and/or controlling the position of the nodes. The distributed algorithms rely on the estimation of strongly connected
  components of a dynamic network topology, accomplished
  through the utilization of the maximum consensus algorithm.
  The proposed strategies are scalable and converge in a finite
  number of steps without requiring information on the overall
  network topology. Finally, the proposed distributed algorithm
  is demonstrated through two case studies of ensuring strong
  connectivity in wireless networks with static and mobile nodes.
