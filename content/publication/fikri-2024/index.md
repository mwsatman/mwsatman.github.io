abstract: This paper considers the problem of multi-robot
  task allocation given by a binary optimization problem with
  nonsmooth objective functions for persistent monitoring over
  large dispersed areas, which is challenging to solve for a
  large number of robots and areas. To overcome this issue, we
  first propose quadratic objective functions to approximate the
  original nonsmooth objective functions. Inspired by the nature
  of the constraint of the problem, a simple strategy is presented
  to ensure the concavity of the quadratic functions. Finally, 
  combining the fact that the constraint matrix of the optimization
  problem is Totally Unimodular allows us to relax the binary
  decision variables into continuous ones without changing the
  optimal solutions. We demonstrate using a case study that
  compared to the original problem, the proposed approximation
  provides less computational burden with occasional negligible
  trade-offs in the optimality of the solution. The comparison of
  the two objective functions for task allocation is also provided.
