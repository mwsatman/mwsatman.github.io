abstract: The strong connectivity of a directed graph associated with the communication
  network topology is crucial in ensuring the convergence of many distributed estimation/control/optimization
  algorithms. However, the assumption on the network's strong connectivity may not
  always be satisfied in practice. In addition, information on the overall network
  topology is often not available, e.g., due to privacy concerns or geographical constraints
  which calls for a distributed algorithm. This paper aims to fill a crucial gap in
  the literature due to the absence of a fully distributed algorithm to verify and
  ensure in finite-time the strong connectivity of a directed network. Specifically,
  inspired by the maximum consensus algorithm we propose distributed algorithms that
  enable individual node in a networked system to verify the strong connectivity of
  a directed graph and further, if necessary, augment a minimum number of new links
  to ensure the directed graph's strong connectivity. The proposed distributed algorithms
  are implemented without requiring information of the overall network topology and
  are scalable as they only require finite storage and converge in finite number of
  steps. Furthermore, the algorithms also preserve the privacy in terms of the overall
  network's topology. Finally, the proposed distributed algorithms are demonstrated
  and evaluated via numerical results.
