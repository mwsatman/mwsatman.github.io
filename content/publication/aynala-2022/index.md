abstract: This paper presents a real-time cooperative control algorithm for multi-robot
  systems to perform formation maintenance and navigate through the environment while
  avoiding collision with static obstacles and among different group formations of
  robots. The control algorithm is computed by solving a quadratic program and utilizing
  the control barrier function to efficiently incorporate multiple control objectives
  in a unified manner and provide a safety certificate. In addition, a novel method
  for collision avoidance among different formations of robots is presented which
  only requires a representative robot in each formation to communicate with each
  other and thus reduces the required communication between the robots. The cooperative
  control algorithm is verified using a robotic experimental testbed.
