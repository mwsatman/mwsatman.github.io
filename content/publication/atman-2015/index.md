abstract: This paper focused on the design and implementation of guidance and gain-scheduling
  autopilot for modeled rocket. Autopilot implemented by using classical gain-scheduling
  method that designed to work within certain velocity and angle-of-attack (AOA).
  Input command for the autopilot is provided by guidance system which processed kinematic
  and dynamic of the rocket, so it could follow the desired trajectory. Guidance and
  autopilot were implemented together with the navigation system and nonlinear model
  of the rocket using Hardware-in Loop Simulation (HILS) on PC/104. Results showed
  that the designed gain-scheduling autopilot is stable on nonlinear model tests and
  also on delay effect and digital implementation tests, with acceptable transient
  and steady state performance. Integration with navigation system showed that the
  overall systems could follow the desired trajectory with 10 m final error distance
  on windy condition.
