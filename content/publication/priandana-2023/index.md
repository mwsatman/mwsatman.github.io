abstract: Persistent monitoring is important in indoor farming to maintain a safe
  environment for plant growth. Typically, various static sensors are employed to
  ensure continuous surveillance within indoor farming. However, these static sensors
  are susceptible to damage, and repairing them can be time-consuming. Such repairs
  can disrupt the real-time monitoring process. In this study, we employ Crazyflie
  swarmUAVs to substitute for malfunctioning static sensors while they undergo repairs
  or replacements. The primary objective of this research is to develop Ant Colony
  Optimization (ACO) and Cloud-Based Drone Navigation (CBDN) algorithms to minimize
  the global waiting time of the swarm UAV network. Simulation results showed that
  the proposed modified algorithm successfully allocates the Crazyflie UAVs to specific
  task areas and enables efficient battery charging, thereby minimizing the overall
  travel time.
