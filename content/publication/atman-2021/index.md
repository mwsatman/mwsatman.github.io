abstract: This paper considers the problem of distributively verifying and ensuring
  strong connectivity of directed networks. Strong connectivity of a directed graph
  associated with the communication network topology is crucial in ensuring the convergence
  of many distributed algorithms. Specifically, inspired by maximum consensus algorithm,
  we first propose a distributed algorithm that enables nodes in a networked system
  to verify strong connectivity of a directed graph. Then, given an arbitrary weakly
  connected directed graph, we develop a distributed algorithm to augment additional
  links to ensure the directed graph's strong connectivity. Both algorithms are implemented
  without requiring information of the overall network topology and are scalable (linearly
  with the number of nodes) as they only require finite storage and converge in finite
  number of steps. Finally, the proposed distributed algorithms are demonstrated via
  several examples.
