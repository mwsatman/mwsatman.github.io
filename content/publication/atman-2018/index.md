abstract: This paper investigates coordination between a human operator and robotic
  swarm. The objective is to guarantee human-enabled motion synchronization to desired
  position/velocity references. The presence of a human in the system could improve
  performance in completing complex missions and adaptation to changes in environment
  or mission goal. Although in some works the human is modeled or assumed as a passive
  system, this does not always hold and a systematic solution to deal with non-passive
  humans is still needed. To this end, this paper assumes the human operator's process
  as a passivity-short system. Based on the positive feedback interconnection of passivity-short
  systems, we present a novel distributed control architecture interconnecting the
  human operator and the robotic swarm. The control goals are then proved to be achieved
  even in the presence of passivity shortage in the human operator. We finally demonstrate
  the proposed architecture through simulation studies and also implementation on
  an experimental testbed.
