abstract: This paper focuses on the development of a resilient cooperative control
  system for leader-follower consensus problems prone to external cyber-attacks. The
  attackers are assumed to adversely impact data integrity and privacy by (i) injecting
  unknown bounded exogenous signals to actuators and (ii) eavesdropping on the physical
  states of followers. To mitigate the adverse effects of such attacks on the consensus,
  privacy, and stability of leader-follower systems, we develop a resilient cooperative
  control system by introducing virtual states interconnected with the physical states
  in such a way that the leader-follower consensus is guaranteed under unknown false
  data injection cyber-attacks. The dynamics of the virtual states act as a dynamical
  output mask, which maps the physical states of followers to some virtual states
  that are exchanged via a communication network. A Lyapunov-based design framework
  is proposed to guarantee stability and the leader-follower consensus against cyber-attacks.
  The decentralized design of the control variables in the proposed resilient cooperative
  control approach facilitates creating a plug-and-play environment, where follower
  nodes can easily be plugged in/out. The effectiveness of the theoretical results
  is evaluated using several numerical examples and implementation on a planar robot
  experimental testbed.
