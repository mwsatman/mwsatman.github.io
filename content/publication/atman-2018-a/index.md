abstract: Presence of a human operator in cooperation with a robotic swarm could enhance
  the mission performance and accommodate the sudden changes in environments or the
  goals. This paper investigates two similar architectures for a semi-autonomous robotic
  swarm under a passivity-short assumption of the human operator. The two architectures
  differ only in the visual feedback given to the human operator. In addition, we
  present the proofs that both architectures ensure the objective which is position/velocity
  synchronization of the robotic swarm to references determined by the human. Further
  analysis in differences between both architectures is then presented, by considering
  the same velocity command from the human operator and inspecting the visual feedbacks
  of each architecture. In addition, the effects on the transparency of all robots'
  actual trajectories to the visual feedback are also discussed. Finally, investigation
  involving several test-subjects is conducted by using human-in-the-loop simulation
  to investigate human responses on both architectures.
