abstract: In this paper, we propose a robotic network cooperative control law under
  inter-robot communication delay. This controller guarantees human operator enabled
  positions/velocities synchronization of robotic network to human desired values.
  First, we show passivity of the interconnected system of each robot and proposed
  control law. Furthermore, passivity of robotic network is also shown by applying
  scattering transformation to communication channels between each robot. Then, positions/velocities
  synchronization to human desired values are proved with input strict passivity assumptions
  of human's decision making process. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
  the presented control law through simulation and experiment.
