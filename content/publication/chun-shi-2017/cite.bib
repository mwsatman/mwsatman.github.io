 abstract = {In this paper, we propose a robotic network cooperative control law under inter-robot communication delay. This controller guarantees human operator enabled positions/velocities synchronization of robotic network to human desired values. First, we show passivity of the interconnected system of each robot and proposed control law. Furthermore, passivity of robotic network is also shown by applying scattering transformation to communication channels between each robot. Then, positions/velocities synchronization to human desired values are proved with input strict passivity assumptions of human's decision making process. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented control law through simulation and experiment.},
