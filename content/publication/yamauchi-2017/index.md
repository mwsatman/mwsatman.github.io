abstract: In this paper, we propose a cooperative control law of human-robotic networks
  in the presence of inter-robot communication delays. The objective is to guarantee
  human enabled synchronization of positions of robotic network to desired reference.
  We first design a cooperative controller to be implemented on each robot so that
  their motion are synchronized to a reference motion desired by a human operator.
  Then, we point out that each robot motion ensures passivity. Furthermore, inter-robot
  communication channels are designed via so-called scattering transformation which
  is a technique to passify the delayed channel. The resulting robotic network is
  then connected with human operator based on passivity theory. In order to demonstrate
  the present control architecture, we build an experimental testbed consisting of
  multiple robots and an interface for interactions with human operator. In particular,
  we analyze the effects of the communication delays on the human operator's behavior.
