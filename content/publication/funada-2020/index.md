abstract: One reason why multirobot systems are preferred, in some contexts, over
  their single-robot counterparts is that they admit a larger spatial footprint. With
  multiple robots, it is possible to span a large area, which is desirable in applications
  such as search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and perimeter patrol [1]. However,
  as interrobot distances grow, so do the communication delays experienced among the
  robots, making precise, coordinated control hard to achieve [2]-[5].
