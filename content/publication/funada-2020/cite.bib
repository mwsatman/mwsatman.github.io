 abstract = {One reason why multirobot systems are preferred, in some contexts, over their single-robot counterparts is that they admit a larger spatial footprint. With multiple robots, it is possible to span a large area, which is desirable in applications such as search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and perimeter patrol [1]. However, as interrobot distances grow, so do the communication delays experienced among the robots, making precise, coordinated control hard to achieve [2]-[5].},
