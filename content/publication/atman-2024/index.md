abstract: The deployment of a group of robots equipped with sensors for monitoring,
  also known as a robotic sensor network, is a promising technological solution to
  solve time-critical societal and environmental issues. This paper considers the
  problem of deploying a robotic sensor network to persistently and effectively monitor
  multiple locations of interest in a large field represented by grids. To this end,
  we propose a novel two-layer control framework where the first layer (i.e., task
  allocation strategy) encapsulates the targeted grids into a set of tasks (small
  regions of interest) followed by optimally allocating the robots to each task based
  on their initial position (location of their base stations) and sensing capabilities.
  The second layer (i.e., persistent monitoring algorithm) generates each robot's
  motion control input to ensure persistent monitoring over the designated region
  of interest. The proposed framework is demonstrated and evaluated via numerical
  simulations. It is shown that the proposed control framework improves real-time
  monitoring in terms of both the coverage performance and travel distance of the
  robots.
