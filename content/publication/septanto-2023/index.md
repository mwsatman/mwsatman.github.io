abstract: State-of-charge is an important variable in a battery management system.
  However, it cannot be measured directly from a battery. Instead, it is estimated
  from measurable variables like current and voltage. This paper addresses a discrete-time
  observer-based SOC estimation such that it has an asymptotic stability guarantee
  with some assumptions. The second-order equivalent circuit model and a piecewise
  linear approximation representing a relationship between the state-of-charge and
  the open circuit voltage are utilized. Simulations are conducted in Python to evaluate
  the designed observer. Some simulation scenarios also include the appearance of
  the model uncertainty, disturbance, and measurement noise. The estimated state-of-charge
  can track the real one for these situations, despite performance degradation.
